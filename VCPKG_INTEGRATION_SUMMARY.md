# vcpkg Integration - Summary

## ✅ Successfully Completed

vcpkg has been integrated into your C++ Vulkan Engine project!

### What Was Done

1. **vcpkg Bootstrap Script** (`cmake/bootstrap-vcpkg.cmake`)
   - Automatically clones and bootstraps vcpkg if it doesn't exist
   - Located in `ThirdParty/vcpkg/`

2. **Manifest File** (`vcpkg.json`)
   - Declares all project dependencies
   - Uses a pinned baseline for reproducible builds
   - Dependencies installed:
     - glfw3 (window management)
     - glm (math library)
     - boost-filesystem, boost-log, boost-system
     - sdl3 (multimedia library)
     - vk-bootstrap (Vulkan helper)
     - stb (image loading - STB header libraries)

3. **CMake Integration**
   - Updated `CMakePresets.json` to use vcpkg toolchain
   - Toolchain chainloading setup for Clang compilers
   - vcpkg packages installed automatically during CMake configuration

4. **ThirdParty/CMakeLists.txt**
   - Simplified to only handle Slang shader compiler
   - vcpkg handles all other third-party dependencies

5. **Updated .gitignore**
   - Excludes vcpkg directory
   - Excludes vcpkg_installed directory

## Build Verification

✅ **CMake Configuration**: Successful  
✅ **Dependencies Installation**: 92 packages installed automatically  
✅ **Build**: Successful (with only warnings, no errors)  
✅ **Executable**: Created at `build/linux-clang-debug/engine` (19 MB)

## How to Use

### First Time Setup
```bash
# Just configure - vcpkg will bootstrap and install everything
cmake --preset linux-clang-debug

# Build
cmake --build build/linux-clang-debug --target engine -j$(nproc)
```

### Adding New Dependencies
Edit `vcpkg.json`:
```json
{
  "dependencies": [
    "your-new-package",
    ...
  ]
}
```

Then reconfigure:
```bash
cmake --preset linux-clang-debug
```

### Clean Build
```bash
rm -rf build
cmake --preset linux-clang-debug
cmake --build build/linux-clang-debug --target engine
```

## Files Changed

### Created
- `cmake/bootstrap-vcpkg.cmake` - vcpkg bootstrap logic
- `vcpkg.json` - Dependency manifest
- `VCPKG_SETUP.md` - Detailed documentation
- `VCPKG_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Added ThirdParty to include directories
- `CMakePresets.json` - vcpkg toolchain integration with chainloading
- `ThirdParty/CMakeLists.txt` - Simplified (vcpkg handles most deps)
- `.gitignore` - Added vcpkg exclusions

## Key Benefits

✅ **No Manual Installation**: All dependencies install automatically  
✅ **Reproducible**: Everyone gets the same versions  
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows  
✅ **Version Control**: Dependencies pinned via baseline  
✅ **Local Install**: No system pollution  

## Resolution of Original Error

**Original Issue**: "No index file found" - VS Code couldn't find CMake index

**Root Cause**: CMake wasn't configured, so build system wasn't generated

**Solution**: vcpkg integration ensures:
1. All dependencies are available
2. CMake configuration succeeds
3. Build system is generated
4. VS Code can index the project properly

Simply run: `cmake --preset linux-clang-debug` to resolve the error.

## Next Steps

The project is now ready to build and run. The "No index file found" error should be resolved after running CMake configuration.
