## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

Folow the principles:

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Extract repeated logic into shared functions or utilities
- Avoid copy-paste implementation drift
- Introduce abstractions when repetition is real, not speculative

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

- Do not build features or abstractions before they are needed
- Avoid speculative generality
- Start simple, then refactor when the pressure is real

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## Naming Conventions

- Variables and functions: `camelCase` with descriptive names
- Booleans: prefer `is`, `has`, `should`, or `can` prefixes
- Interfaces, types, and components: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Custom hooks: `camelCase` with a `use` prefix

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Tools available via MCP integrations. Use them when relevant to the task.

### Context7

Context7 provides up-to-date documentation and code examples directly from official library sources. Use it when:

- You need current API docs, method signatures, or usage patterns for a library.
- The user is working with a framework or package and you're unsure of the exact API.
- You want real, runnable code snippets rather than guessing at an API.

**How to use:** Call `resolve-library-id` with the library name first, then `query-docs`. Prefer Context7 over general knowledge when documentation freshness or accuracy matters.
