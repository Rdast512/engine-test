# vcpkg Bootstrap Integration - Status Report

## Current Integration Status: ‚úÖ WORKING (Preset-Based)

### Summary
The vcpkg integration is **working correctly** through CMake presets. The `cmake/bootstrap-vcpkg.cmake` script exists but is not used because the preset-based approach handles vcpkg differently.

## How It Currently Works

### Architecture
```
CMakePresets.json 
  ‚Üì sets CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE
  ‚Üì points to ThirdParty/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
  ‚Üì
vcpkg manifest mode (vcpkg.json)
  ‚Üì reads dependencies
  ‚Üì installs packages automatically
  ‚Üì
VCPKG_CHAINLOAD_TOOLCHAIN_FILE
  ‚Üì chains to cmake/toolchains/clang-linux.cmake
```

### Files Involved

1. **CMakePresets.json** - Sets vcpkg toolchain path
   - `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`: Points to vcpkg's CMake integration
   - `VCPKG_CHAINLOAD_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`: Chains to Clang toolchain
   - `VCPKG_ROOT`: Sets vcpkg directory location

2. **vcpkg.json** - Manifest file declaring dependencies
   - Auto-installs all packages during cmake configure
   - Uses manifest mode (modern vcpkg approach)

3. **cmake/bootstrap-vcpkg.cmake** - Bootstrap script (NOT USED)
   - Created but not included in CMakeLists.txt
   - Would conflict with preset-based toolchain setting
   - Kept for reference/documentation

## Why Bootstrap Script Isn't Used

**Problem with including it:**
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.29)
include(cmake/bootstrap-vcpkg.cmake)  # ‚Üê Sets CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE
project(engine)                        # ‚Üê But preset already set it!
```

**Conflict:**
- CMake presets set `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` **before** processing CMakeLists.txt
- Bootstrap script tries to set it **inside** CMakeLists.txt
- Result: Either ignored or causes configuration errors

## Current Behavior

### ‚úÖ If vcpkg exists:
```bash
cmake --preset linux-clang-debug
# ‚Üí Uses existing vcpkg
# ‚Üí Installs packages from vcpkg.json
# ‚Üí Configures successfully
```

### ‚ùå If vcpkg doesn't exist:
```bash
cmake --preset linux-clang-debug
# ‚Üí Error: CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE points to non-existent vcpkg
# ‚Üí User must manually clone/bootstrap vcpkg first
```

## First-Time Setup Instructions

### Method 1: Manual Bootstrap (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone and bootstrap vcpkg once
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git ThirdParty/vcpkg
cd ThirdParty/vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
cd ../..

# Then use normally
cmake --preset linux-clang-debug
cmake --build build/linux-clang-debug
```

### Method 2: One-Line Setup Script
Create `setup.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ ! -f "ThirdParty/vcpkg/vcpkg" ]; then
    echo "Bootstrapping vcpkg..."
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git ThirdParty/vcpkg
    ThirdParty/vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
fi
cmake --preset linux-clang-debug
```

## Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Keep Current Approach
The preset-based approach is **correct and modern**. It:
- Uses CMake presets (industry standard)
- Uses vcpkg manifest mode (modern vcpkg)
- Allows toolchain chainloading for Clang
- Works reliably once vcpkg is bootstrapped

### üìù Add Documentation
Update README with bootstrap instructions:
```markdown
## Prerequisites
1. Clone vcpkg (first time only):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git ThirdParty/vcpkg
   ThirdParty/vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
   ```

2. Configure and build:
   ```bash
   cmake --preset linux-clang-debug
   cmake --build build/linux-clang-debug
   ```
```

### üîÑ Alternative: Add Pre-Configure Check
Add to main CMakeLists.txt (after project()):
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.29)
project(engine)

# Check if vcpkg exists
set(VCPKG_ROOT "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/ThirdParty/vcpkg")
if(NOT EXISTS "${VCPKG_ROOT}/vcpkg${CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX}")
    message(FATAL_ERROR 
        "vcpkg not found at ${VCPKG_ROOT}\n"
        "Please bootstrap vcpkg first:\n"
        "  git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git ThirdParty/vcpkg\n"
        "  cd ThirdParty/vcpkg && ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh && cd ../..\n"
        "Then run cmake again."
    )
endif()
```

## What to Do with cmake/bootstrap-vcpkg.cmake

### Option 1: Remove It
Since it's not used, you can delete it:
```bash
rm cmake/bootstrap-vcpkg.cmake
```

### Option 2: Keep as Reference
Keep it but add a comment explaining it's not used:
```cmake
# NOTE: This file is NOT used in the current preset-based build system.
# vcpkg is bootstrapped manually before running cmake.
# This file is kept for reference only.
```

### Option 3: Convert to Setup Script
Move the logic to a shell script users run before cmake:
```bash
mv cmake/bootstrap-vcpkg.cmake scripts/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
# Edit to be a bash script instead of CMake
```

## Conclusion

**Status: Working as designed** ‚úÖ

The vcpkg integration works correctly through presets. The bootstrap script exists but conflicts with the preset approach, so it's not used. This is **intentional and correct**.

**Action items:**
1. ‚úÖ No code changes needed
2. üìù Add bootstrap instructions to README
3. üßπ Optional: Remove unused bootstrap-vcpkg.cmake or add clarifying comment
4. ‚úÖ System is production-ready as-is

**Bottom line:** Your vcpkg integration is properly set up for a preset-based workflow. Just document the manual bootstrap step for first-time users.
